Before you run this code, change the ["this.x" value in the model.js file](https://github.com/zakaton/croquet-audio/blob/master/model.js#L3) so you run a unique instance.

Also, if you plan on running it locally, change the [QR code url in the index.js file](https://github.com/zakaton/croquet-audio/blob/master/index.html#L58) so you can replace the url with whatever your local ip is (e.g. https://1.2.3.4:5500/microphone.html)
